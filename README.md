Weather Underground Forecast Sample

* This is a sample app that is using the web services from weather underground.  It attempts to pull in the forecast from the service by using the device's current location.

* The documentation for the weather underground api can be found here.. http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs


TODO:
* create the search as you type response and use that for the weather instead of just current location
* display the different forecasts

Build:
* This project uses Cocoapods and requires cocoapods to be on your machine in order to run.  For more information about installing cocoapods on your machine, go here www.cocoapods.org.

* once you install cocoapods, in the root folder where the `Podfile` exists, in your terminal run pod install.  when its done you will then need to build the project from .xcworkspace file instad of the .proj file
